Firstly, three files must be uploaded to the main directory of your Google Drive. These files are 'train.csv', 'test.csv', 
and 'stopwords.txt'.
The stopwords file has been included with this assignment submission. If it's not in the same directory as this readme, 
then I'm sure it's not far away.
To clarify, the three files should be in the  /content/gdrive/'My Drive'/  folder.


To run the .ipynb files in Colab:

    - Go to Colab
    - If you don't see a popup with an upload tab, click File -> Open notebook...
    - Click on the upload tab and select the file you would like to upload
    - Once the file has loaded in, you'll see two or three cells in any of the notebooks
    - IMPORTANT: The cell that contains the following code MUST be run first in order to link up Colab and your Google Drive
    - Follow the instructions to link up the notebook to your Google Drive
    - Then run the actual code cell
    - Note: the multi-layer perceptron file takes a long time to run
